# Caldera Members
Simple member plugin for WordPress.

This is a processor that adds the currently logged in user to a "plan". It also provides a function and shortcode for content restriction. That's pretty much it -- build your own custom membership system using [Caldera Forms](https://CalderaForms.com) and our [many fine Caldera Forms add-ons](https://calderawp.com/caldera-forms-add-ons/).

Requires Caldera Forms 1.3.1

BTW: Checking out repo or downloading zip requires `composer update` -- use /releases dir to get built zip.
